# A Comparative Study of Ant Colony Optimisation, Genetic Algorithm and Hybrid ACO-DRL Models for Greener Logistics 
•	Leveraged data analytics to support the transition to low-carbon energy by implementing Machine Learning models to optimize logistics routes and reduce CO2 emissions.
•	Used K-Means Clustering for geographic segmentation of a dataset with over 42,000 UPS warehouse and drop-box locations, improving the efficiency of route optimization.
•	Tools & Technologies: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas), K-Means Clustering, ACO, GA, DRL, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and data preprocessing techniques for outlier detection and route optimization.
•	Results: ACO reduced CO2 emissions by up to 97% compared to GA, with the ACO-DRL hybrid model performing well in specific cases, enhancing logistics sustainability.
